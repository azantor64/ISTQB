## Defect, Error, Bug, Failure and Fault!
> The **defect** is an error found AFTER the application goes into production.

>An **error** is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer.

>A **bug** is the result of a coding error. 

>Error can be any mistake or can be an expected error when you are not giving correct input. But bug is when output deviates from expected result

> **Fault**:An incorrect step, process or data definition in a computer program that causes the program to perform in an unintended or unanticipated manner.
