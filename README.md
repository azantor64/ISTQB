# ISTQB

##  Why testing is so important in software development?
    >...to find errors, gaps, or missing requirements in comparison to the actual requirements. 
    >...Determining the performance of the software
    >...Satisfaction of the customer
    >...Security etc..
    
## Defect, Error, Bug, Failure and Fault!
> The **defect** is an error found AFTER the application goes into production.

>An **error** is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer.

>A **bug** is the result of a coding error. 

>Error can be any mistake or can be an expected error when you are not giving correct input. But bug is when output deviates from expected result

> **Fault**:An incorrect step, process or data definition in a computer program that causes the program to perform in an unintended or unanticipated manner.

**Exhaustive testing is a test approach in which all possible data combinations are used for testing.**


## Causes of software defects ##
 
- Miscommunication of requirements introduces error in code
- Unrealistic time schedule for development
- Lack of designing experience
- Lack of coding practices experience
- Human factors introduces errors in code
- Lack of version control
- Buggy third-party tools
- Last minute changes in the requirement introduce error
- Poor Software testing skill

> Validation is the process of evaluating the final product to check whether the software meets the customer expectations and requirements.

> Verification is to check whether the software conforms to specifications.

> Validation is the process of checking whether the specification captures the customer's needs. “Did I build what I said I would?”

> Verification is the process of checking that the software meets the specification.  “Did I build what I need?”

## How much testing is enough? when to stop?

- 100% Requirements coverage is achieved.
- Defined / Desired Defect count is reached.
- All Show Stopper defects or Blockers are fixed and No known Critical / Severity 1 defect is in Open Status.
- All High Priority defects are identified and fixed.
- Very few Medium Priority defects are open and have a workaround in place.
- Very few low priority open defects that do not impact software usage.
- Test Coverage should be 95% achieved.
- Test case Pass Rate should be 95%. 
- All critical Test cases are passed.
- 5% Test cases can be failed but the Failed Test cases are of low priority.
- Complete Functional Coverage is achieved.

## Pls ask your self then : 


-  Are all test cases executed at least once?
-  Is the Test Case Pass rate as defined?
-  Is complete test coverage achieved?
- Are all functional / Business flows executed at least once?
- Is the decided defect count reached?
-  Are all Major High Priority Defects fixed and closed?
- Have all Defects been Retested and closed?
- Has Regression been done for all open defects?
-  Have you exhausted the testing budget?
- Has the Testing end time reached?
-  Are all Test Deliverables reviewed and published?
